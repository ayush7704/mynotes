        <li>
            comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
        </li>
        <li>
            javascript variables with diffrent and unique names called identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
        </li>

        <li>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). <br>
            + Addition <br>
            - Subtraction <br>
            * Multiplication <br>
            / Division <br>
            % Modulus <br>
            ++ Increment <br>
            -- Decrement <br>
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript Arrays <br>
            JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
            Array items are separated by commas. JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single
            variable.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript Objects <br>
            JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.
            Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>NULL <br>
            In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. the typeof null is
            object
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript Functions <br>
            A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
            A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
        </li>
        <li>Object Methods <br>
            Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
            Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
        </li>
        <li> javascript Local scope JavaScript Variables :Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of
            variables.<br>
            Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
            Local variables have local scope: They can only be accessed within the function.
        </li>
        <li>Global JavaScript Variables <br>
            A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
            A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.</li>
        <li>The indexOf() method returns the index of (the position of) the first occurrence of a specified text in a
            string:</li>
        <li>The slice() Method <br>
            slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
            The method takes 2 parameters: the starting index (position), and the ending index (position).
        </li>
        <li>Number()
            Returns a number, converted from its argument. <br>
            parseFloat()
            parses a string and returns a floating point number <br>
            parseInt()
            parses a string and returns a whole number. <br>
            toFixed() returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals:
        </li>
        <li>The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.</li>
        <li>JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be
            represented by a normal JavaScript Number.</li>
        <li>Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation)</li>
        <li>The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.
            It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator:</li>
        <li>The splice() method can be used to add new items to an array it change the real array</li>
        <li>Conditional <br>
            Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. <br> Use the if
            statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.</li>
        <li><b>switch</b> Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.</li>
        <li>When the JavaScript code interpreter reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. When a
            match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break.
            <br> The break statement "jumps out" of a loop. <br>
            The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues
            with the next iteration in the loop.
        </li>
        <li><b>default</b>The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:
        </li>
        <li>Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. <br>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a
            specified condition is true.
        </li>
        <li><b>for in Loops</b>The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object:
        </li>
        <li>The JavaScript for..of statement loops through the elements of an iterable object. iterables can be accessed
            with simple and efficient code.</li>
        <li>The Do/While Loop <br>
            The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before
            checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
        </li>
        <li>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. <br>
            The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations. </li>
        <li>The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors. <br>
            The catch statement lets you handle the error. <br>
            The throw statement lets you create custom errors. <br>
            The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.</li>
        <li>Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation
            slows down the display.
        </li>
        <li>when we assign a function to a variable it become function expression</li>
        <li>A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values. Each value can only occur once in a Set.</li>
        <li>A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.</li>
        <li>
            Domain: <br>
            A domain is the unique address that people use to access your website on the internet. It's what users type
            into their browser's address bar to find your website.
        </li>
        <li>A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods.</li>
        <li>The constructor property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.</li>
        <li>The instanceof operator returns true if an object is an instance of the specified object: obj instanceof
            Array</li>
        <li>The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

            The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try
            block.</li>
        <li>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
            Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).</li>
    </ol>

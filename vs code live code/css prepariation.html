    <ol>
        <li>CSS Selectors
            <br>
            CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class,
            attribute, and more.
        </li>
        <li>Shorthand property <br>
            it is also possible to specify all the properties in one single property. This is called a
            shorthand property.</li>
        <li>CSS Margin Properties <br>
            The CSS margin properties are used to generate space around elements.</li>
        <li>Setting max-width <br>
            The problem with the &lt;div&gt; if the set the width of the to 500 px
            and the browser window is smaller than it <br>
            The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page. <br>
            Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.</li>
        <li>The display Property <br>
            Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display
            value for most elements is block or inline.
        </li>
        <li>Display: none; <br>
            display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating
            them.
        </li>
        <li>Overlapping Elements <br>
            When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. <br>
            The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or
            behind, the others). <br>
            An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
        </li>
        <li>What are Pseudo-classes? <br>
            A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. <br>
            Style an element when a user mouses over it <br>
            Style visited and unvisited links differently <br>
            Style an element when it gets focus <br>
        </li>

        <li>What are Pseudo-Elements? <br>
            A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
        </li>
        <li>CSS [attribute] Selector <br>
            The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.
        </li>
        <li>css3 <br>
            Some of the most important CSS3 modules are: <br>
            Selectors
            (Box Model)
            (Backgrounds and Borders) (Image Values and Replaced Content)
            (Text Effects)
            (2D/3D Transformations)
            (Animations)
            (Multiple Column Layout)
        </li>
        <li>CSS3 Transforms <br>
            CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
            A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position.
        </li>
        <li>CSS3 Transitions<br>
            CSS3 transitions allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given
            duration.
        </li>
        <li>css Animations <br>
            an element change from the current style to the new style at certain times.</li>
        <li>CSS3 Multi-column Layout <br>
            The CSS3 multi-column layout allow us to create multiple column - just like in newspapers:
        </li>
        <li>CSS3 Box Sizing <br>
            The CSS3 box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and
            height.
        </li>
        <li>flexbox <br>
            flexbox is a new layout mode in css3 <br>
            Use of flexbox makes that elements behave predictably when the page layout comes in (must accommodate)
            different screen sizes and different display devices.
        </li>
        <li>The justify-content Property <br>
            The justify-content property horizontally aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use
            all available space on the main-axis.
        </li>
        <li>The align-items Property <br>
            The align-items property vertically aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all
            available space on the cross-axis.
        </li>
        <li>What is Responsive Web Design? <br>
            Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
            Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
        </li>
        <li>What is The Viewport? <br>
            The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div>Let the user resize the width of this div element.</div>

        <li>
            javascript variables with diffrent and unique names called identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
        </li>
        <li>
            dollar sign and underscore treated as a letter
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>let</b><br>Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.Variables defined with let must be declared
            before use. Variables defined with let have block scope.
        </li>
        <li>
            variable declare with let keybord must be declare once around the scope
        </li>
        <li>
            can't use variable let before declare but with var can
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>const</b><br>
            Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.Variables defined with const cannot be
            Reassigned.Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
        </li>
        <li>Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:</li>
        <li>
            JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be
            represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
        </li>
        <li>
            -1 , 0 treated as 0 in substring method
        </li>
        <li>The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
            The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).</li>
        <li>With template literals, you can use both single and double quotes inside a string:</li>
        <li>
            iteration It simply means looping over a sequence of elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values string , number , boolean ,object ,
            function
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 6 types of objects: array , date , object , string , boolian , number
        </li>
        <li><b>regExp</b>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.</li>
        <li>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. </li>
        <li>Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. <br>
            Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
        </li>
        <li>All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 
        </li>
        <li>Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.
        </li>
        <li>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope initializations are not hoisted,</li>
        <li>as its name 'use strict' mode works strickly With strict mode, you can not,  use undeclared variables</li>
        <li>The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods. They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.</li>
        <li>in Arrow Functions, the "this" keyword represents the object that owns the function, no matter who calls the function.</li>
        <li>A JavaScript class is not an object. javascript classes are template for objects</li>
        <li>JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. this makes t easier to maintain a code-base.</li>
        <li>Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.        </li>
        <li>Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.        </li>
        <li>A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.        </li>
